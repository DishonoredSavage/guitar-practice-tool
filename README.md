# CAGED System Practice Tool

## Prerequisites
- Processing 3.0 or later

## Reasons For Building
I built this tool because I could not find a website which dynamically displays root notes and scales/chords with keyboard input.  The majority of websites require the user to select the root and scale/chord from a drop down menu and the page is reloaded upon selection (which can be tedious and slow).  I also could not find a tool which allows the user to toggle C A G E D shapes, which this tool allows, saving the user from searching for a certain shape for a specific chord/scale. This tool also allows the user to toggle different combinations of C A G E D shapes, which is useful for practising the same scale/chord up and down the fretboard, rather than being restricted to one position.

## Features
- displays notes across a fretboard of up to 23 frets (not including fret 0), 
dynamically updating the frets to play according to the user's selection
- user can select one of the 7 chord types or one of the 12 scale types (or 
just have root notes displayed)
- user can toggle any combination of C A G E D shapes
- user can change the number of frets displayed
- displays information about current selection and other available scale/chord types
- controls can be toggled with 'i'/'I' - all selections are made using keyboard
- 7 chord types:  maj, min, maj7, min7, 7, maj6, min6
- 12 scale types: minor pentatonic, blues scale, major pentatonic, 
harmonic minor, melodic minor, major/ Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, 
natural minor/ Aeolian, Locrian

## Potential Updates
- support for more strings (e.g. 7/8/9)
- support for different tunings (would not support C A G E D system)
